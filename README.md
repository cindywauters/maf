Modular Analysis Framework (MAF): A Framework for Modular Analysis of Dynamic Languages

# Goal
The goal of this artefact is to experiment with abstract machines and language
semantics. Currently, the artefact's implementation is focused towards experiments with modular analyses.
Additionally, semantics for R5RS Scheme are present.

# Usage
The MAF framework can be used in several ways.

## Using the JavaScript visual front-end
The framework includes a JavaScript front-end that can be used to visualise a MODF analysis in the browser.
To run this visualisation, open the file `maf.html` with your browser. The visualisation provides information with
regard to the work list (coloured in light blue) and currently analysed component (coloured in dark blue).
Stepping through the visualisation can be done using the space bar.

If you need to compile the code first, run the command `fastOptJS` within your sbt repl.

## Analysing a program using command line
The MAF framework is built in a modular style. To run a modular analysis, you need to compose the
implementation of a specific machine and an abstract domain.

To analyze a specific program, an instance of the MODF analysis class must be created. The constructor of
this class takes a parsed version of the program to be analysed, which can be obtained as follows:
```scala
val text = io.Reader.loadFile(path-to-file)
val prog = language.scheme.Schemeparser.parse(text)
```
Additional preprocessing steps are performed by the modular analysis itself and hence must not be performed manually.

Now, the MODF instance can be created. For example, to analyze `prog` using a big-step MODF analysis
with full argument sensitivity and a type domain:
```scala
val analysis = new ModAnalysis(prog) with BigStepSemantics
                                     with StandardSchemeModFSemantics
                                     with FullArgumentSensitivity
                                     with TypePropagationDomain
analysis.analyze()
```
Method `analyze` computes the full (and sound) analysis result for the program that `ModAnalysis` is constructed with. 
This method does not return the analysis results directly.
Rather, after calling `analyze`, the computed analysis results (e.g., the final store and dependencies) can be accessed through the properties of the `analysis` object (e.g., through `analysis.store` and `analysis.deps`).

Alternatively, one can use the `analyzeWithTimeout(<timeout>)` method to run the analysis with a given timeout. This timeout is obtained from a Java Duration
(using `Timeout.start(<duration>)`). 
The method returns when either the analysis has terminated or when the timeout has been reached (approximately, meaning in practice it may run a bit longer than the specified timeout). 
Extra care should be taken when using this method, as the (partial) analysis results are not guaranteed to be sound when the timeout is triggered. 
Therefore, when using this method, it is recommended to explicitly check afterwards if the analysis terminated using the `finished` method.

# Running the test suite
This repository is monitored by a CI-system. Upon every push and pull request to this repository, the test suite is run on a specific subset of benchmark programs (MAF tests on action). 
In addition, the full test suite is run over night (Daily MAF tests).

Current status:
<!-- https://github.com/badges/shields -->
![Latest build](https://github.com/softwarelanguageslab/maf/workflows/MAF%20tests%20on%20action/badge.svg) 
![Nightly tests](https://github.com/softwarelanguageslab/maf/workflows/Daily%20MAF%20tests/badge.svg)

The full test suite of MAF can easily be run manually using sbt:
```sbtshell
maf/test
```

To allow specific tests to be run, tags have been added to the test suite. 
 * Following tags can be used to select the component of the framework that should (not) be tested: `ParserTest`, `LatticeTest`, `PrimitiveTest` and `SoundnessTest`.
 * Following tags can be used to select which benchmark programs (not) to run: `SlowTest`.
 * Following tags can be used to test utility components of the framework: `UtilTest`.

The `SlowTest` tag currently is only used for some of the soundness tests. When these tests are disabled, only a part of the available benchmark programs
will be used.

To run tests with a specific tag, the sbt command `maf/testOnly` should be used. The `-n` flag indicates test tags that should be
included from testing, whereas the `-l` flag indicates tags that should be excluded from testing.

For example, to run the parser tests, the following command can be used:
```sbt
maf/testOnly -- -n ParserTest
```
(Note the double -- before any possible flags.)<br>
To run all soundness tests, but only on a fast subset of benchmark programs, the command
```sbt
maf/testOnly -- -n SoundnessTest -l SlowTest
```
can be executed.

MAF is a complete rework of the [Scala-AM framework](https://github.com/acieroid/scala-am), which was not focused on
modular static analysis but was primarily used to experiment with AAM-style analyses. Scala-AM is described in the
